# Assets

Assets are organized in one shared location for both maps:

- `assets/kenney`
- `assets/custom`
- `assets/other_sources`

## What Each Folder Means

- `assets/kenney`: original Kenney assets
- `assets/custom`: custom assets made/edited for these maps
- `assets/other_sources`: other source assets prepared for runtime use

## Author Credit

Custom map assets and modifications are by:
- `Abdulla Alnasser`

These custom assets are your rights and are covered by the same project license as the maps:
- `assets/custom/*`

Assets under `assets/other_sources/*` are third-party/open-source files and follow their original licenses.

## License

Project map license:
- `../LICENSE_CUSTOM_MAPS.md`

## Runtime Note

Runtime uses `.obj` + `.mtl` + texture images.
